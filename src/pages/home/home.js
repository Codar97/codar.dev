      I guess this is supposed to be a paragraph about me and what I do.
      Well I am Sam and I code stuff for fun, usually that stuff isn't very useful but fun.
      In some cases I work on open source projects to feel like I am actually doing something useful.
      I have some useful projects that you can check out.
      Most of my code is open source and MIT licenced.
    </p>
  </div>);
}

export default Home;
